# EuroScopePlugIn's SDK Documentation and Examples Archive
A comprehensive collection of plug-in source codes and the available plug-in development documentation, all in one repository for learning and easy Copilot integration.

## <span style="color:darkkhaki">Preface
For the best reading experience, clone the repository and open the markdown files with a markdown parser, like VSCode or Obsidian (Github doesn't fully support Markdown + HTML/CSS integration in the browser.) If you're facing errors of unresolved external symbols during compile time, make sure to always compile your plug-ins in x86 and not x64, since the original API library is x86 (an upgraded x64 version of the API for plug-in development is underway, but not yet ready — you can read more about it [on this forum](https://forum.vatsim.net/t/euroscope-plug-in-api-upgrade/4936/74).)

# Introduction
To assist with the learning process of developing plug-ins for [EuroScope](https://www.euroscope.hu/wp/), this repository will archive relevant guides and example plug-ins (with added comments). The primary source for this archive is the 2010 *"**Plug-in Developer's Guide** for verison 3.1d (r4)"*, which can be downloaded in full [here](https://www.euroscope.hu/wp/documentation-download/); the contents of this guide were transcribed into a markdown file found in this repository under [Plug-in Developer's Guide](<Plug-in Developer's Guide.md>) to facilitate the integration of Copilot into future development. Any comments will be <span style="color : red">boxed in red </span>.

All content originally cited from the *"**Plug-in Developer's Guide** for verison 3.1d (r4)"*, which has been transcribed into a markdown file with added notes by me, as well as the development header and associated development library, belong to the Euroscope team and were facilitated by *Gergely Csernák*. Proper credit should be given to them for these files.
