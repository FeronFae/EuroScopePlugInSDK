# Introduction
In an effort to ease the learning process for developing plugins for [EuroScope](https://www.euroscope.hu/wp/), this repository will archive all relevant guides and example plugins (alongisde explanations). The original and main source of information for this Archive is the 2010 *"**Plug-in Developer's Guide** for verison 3.1d (r4)"*, which can be downloaded in its entirety [here](https://www.euroscope.hu/wp/documentation-download/); the contents of said file will be transcribed into a markdown file to allow integrating Copilot into future development as more examples get added, and any comments will be <span style="color : red">boxed in red </span>.
