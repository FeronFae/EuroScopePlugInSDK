# EuroScopePlugIn's SDK Documentation and Examples Archive
A comprehensive collection of plug-in source codes and the available plug-in development documentation, all in one repository for learning and easy Copilot integration.

For the best reading experience, clone the repository and open the markdown files with a markdown parser, like VSCode or Obsidian (Github doesn't fully support Markdown + HTML/CSS integration in the browser.)

# Introduction
To assist with the learning process of developing plugins for [EuroScope](https://www.euroscope.hu/wp/), this repository will archive relevant guides and example plugins (with added comments). The primary source for this archive is the 2010 *"**Plug-in Developer's Guide** for verison 3.1d (r4)"*, which can be downloaded in full [here](https://www.euroscope.hu/wp/documentation-download/); the contents of this guide were transcribed into a markdown file found in this repository under [Plug-in Developer's Guide](<Plug-in Developer's Guide.md>) to facilitate the integration of Copilot into future development. Any comments will be <span style="color : red">boxed in red </span>.
